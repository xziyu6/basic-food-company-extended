# Basic Food Company Extended

For some reason, Basic Food Company can only build wheat farms, so I added the grain farms as available charters.

## What It Does

The Basic Food Company can now have industry right charters for all grain farm types:
- Rye Farms
- Rice Farms
- Maize Farms
- Millet Farms

## Details

- **Game Version**: Victoria 3 1.12+
- **Multiplayer**: Yes (synchronized)

## Compatibility
- No conflicts with other mods
- Safe to add to existing saves
- ** Might not be safe to remove from saves (I'm too lazy to do testing) **
- No performance impact
